            <p>Website development is a new avenue for me as a student and so attempting to create two websites through two different platforms created unique challenges through development.
            One of the most significant challenges for me as a new learner would have to be understanding that imagining what your website will look like and then trying to create it, are
            two very different things when developing a website. Trial and error for me was rough as not understanding simple coding shortcuts and tricks made simple ideas to me harder to
            figure out in code. Especially when it came to css coding, being able to work with styling and trying to make my website more appealing and less bulked with style coding throughout
            was also challenging in its own ways. The Nav bar creation alone took significant work to get it to my initial vision I hoped for. Overall, understanding that it takes time to create 
            something that is what I envisioned for my website was the biggest "challenge" in a sense to me.
            </p>
            
            <p>Now when it comes to comparing website creation between GitHub and Wordpress, I believe that both have their own advantages that make them worth using as a platform. For GitHub,
            I would say that the biggest advantage to using GitHub would be that during creation of my website, being able to constantly make changes in XML and seeing the results immediately 
            through my doc file was incredibly useful to see quick changes constantly. This allowed my website development to be more efficient when it came to making changes in code quickly and
            seeing the results fast. I also thought that using GitHub allowed me to have better control of my website as a whole and made me not have to appeal to certain designs or looks no matter 
            what compared to Wordpress. However, I think Wordpress does have the real advantage of being user-friendly overall when it came to creating the website on the platform. Wordpress gives you
            more straight forward creation options through small menus that takes away significant time that would be otherwise spent on areas such as navigation bar, layouts, etc. Overall, I think that 
            both platforms have their distinct advantages to website creation that can easily sway the choice of how someone would want to build their website through. Personally, I believe that the 
            freedom of GitHub is a nicer choice even if this freedom is both good and bad.
            </p>
            
            <p>When it came to modifying the layout and organization of each site there were challenges that were inherently frustrating to deal with at times. Wordpresses layout for inserting images
            into their website were frustrating as the caption, alt text, and description boxes per image were not initially working for each image included into my gallery section. Luckily with 
            constant troubleshooting the issues were able to be fixed and become the same but then more issues arised when it came to moving images around the portion of the website. Flexing the images
            on Wordpress was inherently confusing compared to GitHub, not being able to see how to flex images on Wordpress compared to GitHub made it frustrating overall. That is not to say that GitHub did 
            not have its own challenges when it came to layout and organization of my website. A challenge when it came to first splitting up my html and css files was the fact that my initial code did not 
            have proper sections for areas of my website pages. I also was lacking classes for my elements which also made styling more challenging and forced me to redo more areas of my pages in order to 
            finally seperate the coding to be more efficient which was actually good for me in the end.
            </p>
            
            <p>I would say there are definitely skills that are neededed to be learned and develop websites on either platform. GitHub is more intense on requiring you to understand how to code with html and 
            css. That is not to say that you do not need it completely for Wordpress but GitHub requires more coding knowledge as you basically code from scratch which is why it is so important. This also goes
            in hand with Markdown overall for GitHub. When it comes to Wordpress I think the skills you need are both similar to GitHub with just understanding html and css code but different in the sense of how
            you create a website overall. The biggest skill to me that is needed for Wordpress is being able to navigate the dashboard of Wordpress as a whole. There are a ton of menus and navigation that leads 
            you to many different places of creation for your website and just having that basic knowledge of remembering how to get to places you need to go is super helpful. This sounds simple at first but it
            genuinely fits with the layout and feel of Wordpress overall. </p>
            
            <p>There are a few skills that I want to improve upon when it comes to website creation. The most important skill I want to improve upon as a whole is better understanding of coding for html and css.
            I especially want to get better for this when it comes to using GitHub especially. There are more design changes I want to include into my website but I do not yet understand how to create. My initial
            idea for a navbar was to try and make a drop down menu of a NavBar but it turned out too difficult and I want to try to learn more intricate coding methods to hopefully make this design onto my website.
            When it comes to Wordpress, I would say I want to improve upon learning how to better utilize the options it provides to creators overall. I want to try and better utilize tools such as widgets and
            plugins as I think getting those into my website could really enhance its overall usability and apperance. Overall, I think it all comes down to time. The more time I am able to put into developing
            my websites on either platform, the better the development will go which will lead to my goal of improving my websites.
