            <p>When it comes to comparing these two texts it become pretty apparent that there are distinct similarities between
            the two which makes sense. Both use the phrase "the United States" a ton considering both speeches are addressed to the 
            entire nation. (More to be added in the analysis over time)</p>

            <p>Now since both Inaugural Addresses and State of the Unions consistenly use the 3 gram of "the United States", I decided to go into a bit more analysis with regards to the keywords in context (KWIC).
            Throughout the phrases use, it is more intriguing when you consider the context behind both versions of speeches. Inaugural addresses are used to present a presidents vision for the future and the wording is
            apparent through use of after phrases such as "to secure", "to seek and support", "to maintain". Now when we see the difference in State of the Unions speeches, we are usually given more context into the 
            nation and world events as a whole during that time. That difference is especially apparent with continuations after "the United States" being things such as "to about 3,500,000 acres of land", "the Soviet 
            Union made the historic", or "during the fiscal year was $40,986,912". Now this seems a bit much when it comes to the depth of the phrases used after but I think it highlights the key differences seen 
            between these two versions of speeches/addresses. One version of speecehes is more centered around the basic vision or the "big goal" in mind for the U.S. while the State of the Unions really show the 
            more details of a specific time within a president's term in office.</p>
