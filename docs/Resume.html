            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>"Life is like a roller coaster, sometimes it speeds up and sometimes you turn upside down". 
                I have been within the Erie community since I was born here and have had many acclimated experiences over my time. 
                Since I started my college journey around 4 years ago now I did not know what the future would hold for me, and it was a rough one. 
                I have switched around my major along with being forced to take time off school due to a global pandemic but that has not stopped me from striving to be a better person and learn more. 
                I have worked along with my family business for a substantial amount of time and have been able to learn more about our looking communities and employers such as Erie Insurance a ton. 
                I would say the thing I look forward to the most is what lies ahead beyond college and graduation. 
                How far I reach into my impact on my local community and future companies is up to me and I would say I am ready to take that next step on my journey.</p>
