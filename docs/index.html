        <p><strong>Reptiles</strong> and <strong>amphibians</strong> are two groups of cold-blooded animals with distinct characteristics.</p>
        
        <p>Reptiles have scaly skin and lay hard-shelled eggs, while amphibians have moist skin and undergo a unique life cycle with aquatic and terrestrial stages.</p>
        
        <p>Both play crucial roles in ecosystems and are popular in biology studies, with reptiles having scaly skin and amphibians having moist skin.</p>

        <h6>More Differences between Reptiles and Amphibians</h6>
        
        <p>Although reptiles and amphibians are both cold-blooded vertebrates, there are significant differences in their characteristics and life cycles.</p> 
        
        <p>Reptile eggs are fertilized internally and usually laid on dry land, while amphibian eggs are fertilized after being laid in water. </p>
        
        <p>Reptiles are born with lungs, while amphibians are born with gills for breathing under waterâ€”where they hatch and spend their early development (growing lungs and legs later). </p>
        
        <p>Reptiles have scales, while amphibians have thin, smooth skin. Snakes, turtles, and lizards are reptiles. Frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts are amphibians.</p>
