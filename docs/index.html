        <p>Reptiles and Amphibians were always creatures that were super interesting to me as a kid up until today. I have always wanted to own a reptile as a pet and I used to 
        play with frogs in my grandmothers backyard as a kid. I will now go further into the differences of both Reptiles and Amphibians now.

        <p><strong>Reptiles</strong> and <strong>amphibians</strong> are two groups of cold-blooded
            animals with distinct characteristics.</p>
        
        <p>Reptiles have scaly skin and lay hard-shelled eggs, while amphibians have moist skin and
            undergo a unique life cycle with aquatic and terrestrial stages.</p>
        
        <p>Both play crucial roles in ecosystems and are popular in biology studies, with reptiles
            having scaly skin and amphibians having moist skin.</p>

        <h6>More Differences between Reptiles and Amphibians</h6>
        <!-- These differences should add more depth to the initial page of the website -->
        <p>Although reptiles and amphibians are both cold-blooded vertebrates, there are significant
            differences in their characteristics and life cycles.</p>
        
        <p>Reptile eggs are fertilized internally and usually laid on dry land, while amphibian eggs
            are fertilized after being laid in water. </p>
        
        <p>Reptiles are born with lungs, while amphibians are born with gills for breathing under
            waterâ€”where they hatch and spend their early development (growing lungs and legs later). </p>
        
        <p>Reptiles have scales, while amphibians have thin, smooth skin. Snakes, turtles, and
            lizards are reptiles. Frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts are amphibians.</p>
